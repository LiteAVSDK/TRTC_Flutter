## Environment Requirements

- Flutter 2.0or above
- **Developing for Android:**
  - Android Studio 3.5 or above
  - Devices with Android 4.1 or above
- **Developing for iOS:**
  - Xcode 11.0 or above
  - Your project has a valid developer signature.

## Demo Run Example

#### Prerequisites

You have [signed up](https://www.tencentcloud.com/) for a Tencent Cloud account and completed identity verification.

### Obtaining `SDKAPPID` and `SDKSECRETKEY`

1. Log in to the TRTC console and select **Application Management** > **[Create application](https://console.tencentcloud.com/trtc/app/create)**.
2. Click **Create Application** and enter the application name such as `APIExample`. If you have already created an application, click **Select Existing Application**.

3. Click **Next** to view your `SDKAppID` and key.

### Configuring demo project files

1. Find and open `/lib/Debug/GenerateTestUserSig.dart`.
2. Set parameters in `GenerateTestUserSig.dart` as follows.

> - SDKAPPID: a placeholder by default. Set it to the actual `SDKAppID`.
> - SDKSECRETKEY: a placeholder by default. Set it to the actual key.

3. Click **Next** to complete the creation.
4. After compilation, click **Return to Overview Page**.

> !The method for generating `UserSig` described in this document involves configuring `SDKSECRETKEY` in client code. In this method, `SDKSECRETKEY` may be easily decompiled and reversed, and if your key is disclosed, attackers can steal your Tencent Cloud traffic. Therefore, **this method is suitable only for the local execution and debugging of the demo**.

> The correct `UserSig` distribution method is to integrate the calculation code of `UserSig` into your server and provide an application-oriented API. When `UserSig` is needed, your application can make a request to the business server for dynamic `UserSig`. For more information, please see [How to Calculate UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166).

### Compiling and running the project

1. Run `flutter pub get`.
2. Compile, run, and debug the project.

#### Android

1. Run `flutter run`.
2. Open the demo project with Android Studio (3.5 or above), and click **Run**.

#### iOS

1. Run `pod install`.
2. Open the `/ios` demo project in the source code directory with Xcode (11.0 or above) and compile and run the demo project.
